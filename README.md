I've chosen a project called "Testimonials grid section". The first challenge for me was to implement correct design. It wasn't so hard as I have experience in HTML and CSS but still took some time. The second challenging thing was the fact that I need to use Bootstrap which is still a new thing for me. To solve this, I firstly implemented the design using only HTML and classic CSS methods as such approach is much more convenient for me. After that I changed my code by reducing the CSS part and adding more Bootstrap attributes to the HTML.

If I had more time I would make the next improvements:
1. To make design 100% same as in the requirements. For now it's very similar but still has some insignificant differences from the design provided in the task.
2. I would add more bootstrap properties to reduce the CSS part.
3. I would make more detailed git history, as now I have only one commit, and that's an initial commit.
